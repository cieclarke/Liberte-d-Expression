<h1>About Liberté d’Expression</h1>

<p>Liberté d’Expression was initially set up to organise art exhibitions and provide artists with an opportunity to explore, develop and exhibit their talents and interests, irrespective of their age, experience or artistic background.</p>

<p>Following its first exhibition in 2007, we have also worked with clients to provide artwork (painting, sculpture, photography, installation) for their commercial and residential projects.</p>

<p>Since, we have been involved in a number of exiting projects including product and interior design, song writing, children books and recently animation.</p>
